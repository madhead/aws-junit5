JUnit 5 extensions for AWS

== What is this repo?

This repo contains few JUnit 5 https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions[extensions] that you could find useful for testing AWS-related code.
These extensions can be used to inject clients for AWS service mocks provided by tools like https://github.com/localstack/localstack[localstack] or https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/08/use-amazon-dynamodb-local-more-easily-with-the-new-docker-image/[DynamoDB Local].
Both AWS Java SDK https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html[v 2.x] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/welcome.html[v 1.x] are supported.
Currently, these services are supported:

 - https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb[DynamoDB]
 - https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams[Kinesis Data Streams]
 - https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose[Kinesis Data Firehose]
 - https://aws.amazon.com/s3[S3]
 - https://aws.amazon.com/ses[SES]
 - https://aws.amazon.com/sns[SNS]
 - https://aws.amazon.com/sqs[SQS]
 - https://aws.amazon.com/lambda[Lambda]

== How do I use it?

Read the https://madhead.github.io/aws-junit5/asciidoc[documentation] or the https://madhead.github.io/aws-junit5/javadoc[Javadoc].
I tried to keep it short.
